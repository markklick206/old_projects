Project: BMI567 Final

The final.R Script will download all the data and save certain .pdf figures automatically.

All the analysis data lives here on Box: https://ohsu.box.com/s/brje689rspd6u1y58v61r0esrfg16t3u

Here is a link to my .ppt presentation if the animations didn't transfer over to .pptx format:
